    <p class="sketchnote-square">This curriculum is designed to support teenagers ages 12 - 14 as they become increasingly aware of the world of sexuality.
        Young adolescents are grappling with understanding who they are, what sexuality feels like, and why they and their peers may make different decisions about sexual activities.
        This curriculum is designed to meet them in this place and offer information, context, and structure.
